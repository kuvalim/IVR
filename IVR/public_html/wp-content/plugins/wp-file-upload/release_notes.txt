<!--  --><span>Version 4.2.0 is a significant update bringing two modifications, which are not visible to the users, however they improve its performance.<br/><br/>The first one makes the plugin work better when <strong>caching</strong> is enabled, either from another plugin (e.g. Autoptimize or W3 Total Cache) or from the web server. Speaking more technically, the plugin will render correctly and without errors either its Javascript files load early (in page header) or late (in footer).<br/><br/>The second improvement relates to compression and simplification of the plugin's <strong>inline CSS and Javascript code</strong>. The result is that a page containing the upload form will load a bit faster.<br/><br/>Other less significant changes of this version relate to bug fixes and code improvements.<br/><br/>For more details about this version's changes please visit the Release Notes of the plugin's </span><a href="http://www.iptanus.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-file-upload/">support page</a><span>.</span><!--  -->
